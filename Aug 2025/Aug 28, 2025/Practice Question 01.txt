Practice Question: Student Management System (Using .txt Files)

You are asked to build a Student Management System that allows the user to add, view, search, update, and delete student records.
The system should store all student data inside a students.txt file.

Requirements

RollNo, Name, Age, Grade


Example:
101, Ali Khan, 20, A
102, Sara Ahmed, 19, B


Functionalities to Implement
- Add Student
Ask the user to input RollNo, Name, Age, and Grade, then save it in students.txt.
Make sure the RollNo is unique.

- View All Students
Read all data from students.txt and display it in a tabular format.

- Search Student by RollNo
Ask the user for RollNo and display the student details if found.

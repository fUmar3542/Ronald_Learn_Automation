Practice Question: Library Management System (CSV Based)

Problem Statement:
You are required to build a Library Management System using Python. The system will keep track of books available in the library and books
issued by students. The data should be stored in CSV files, and the program should provide a menu-driven interface for the user.

Requirements:

1. Store Data in CSV Files
Use two CSV files:
books.csv → Stores book details.
issued_books.csv → Stores details of issued books.

2. Books Data Format (in books.csv)
Each book record should be stored in the following format:
book_id,title,author,available_copies

Example:
101,Python Basics,John Smith,5
102,Data Science with Python,Jane Doe,2

3. Issued Books Data Format (in issued_books.csv)
Each issued record should be stored in the following format:
book_id,student_name,issue_date

Example:
101,Ali,2025-08-27
102,Sara,2025-08-26

4. Menu Options
The system should provide a menu like this:
- Add a new book
- View all books
- Issue a book
- View issued books
- Return a book
- Exit

5. Functional Requirements

- Add a new book
Ask user for book ID, title, author, and number of available copies.
Store in books.csv.

- View all books
Display the contents of books.csv in a readable format.

- Issue a book
Ask for student name and book ID.
If available copies > 0 → reduce by 1 and record issue in issued_books.csv with today’s date.
Otherwise, show message: “Book not available.”

- View issued books
Read and display issued_books.csv.

- Return a book
Ask for book ID and student name.

- Remove the record from issued_books.csv.
Increase available copies in books.csv.

# print()
# input()
# if

# Selenium
# first install that library
# We have to import them

# Generate random numbers

# import selenium

# import random
#
# randomNumber = random.randrange(1, 100)
#
# print(randomNumber)


# Practice Question 1 -> You have to write a program in which you have to get an integer from user
# and you have to generate an integer with the help of random library and you have to display them both on console.

# Practice Question 2 -> How to generate a unique number in a specified range with the help of random?


# Strings

myName = "My Name"

print(type(myName))

myNameInLowerCase = myName.lower()

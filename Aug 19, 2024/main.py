# Practice question -> You have to write a program which gets 5 inputs from user and print the odd and even numbers separately.


# number1 = input("Enter nuber 1: ") # 2
# number2 = input("Enter nuber 2: ") # 9
# number3 = input("Enter nuber 3: ") # 10
# number4 = input("Enter nuber 4: ") # 13
# number5 = input("Enter nuber 5: ") # 1
#
# check = number1 % 2 == 0
#
# # Hint : Ternary Operator
# # result = check == False

# Practice question -> You have to write a program which gets 5 inputs from user and print the odd and even numbers separately.

#

number = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 # 2 raise to power 4

# what if 2 ^ 100

# **

# 2 ^ 100
# print(2**100)

# Comparison operators -> == != ! > < >= <=

number2 = 2

# Either one value is equal to other or not
number2 == 2

# != -> Ether one value is not equal to the other

# > -> The number on left side should be greater than the number on right side

# 3. Leap Year Checker
# write a Python program to check if a given year is a leap year using the following logic:
#
# A year is a leap year if:
# It is divisible by 4.
# If it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400.

# Solution

value = input("Enter input: ")


# 4. Triangle Type
# Given the lengths of three sides of a triangle, determine whether the triangle is:
#
# Equilateral (all sides are equal)
# Isosceles (two sides are equal)
# Scalene (all sides are different)
# Not a valid triangle (the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side)
#
# Write a function that takes the lengths of the three sides as input and returns the type of triangle.
#
#

# 5. Write a Python function to determine if a person is eligible for a loan based on the following criteria:
#
# The applicant must be at least 21 years old.
# The applicant must have a steady job with an annual income of at least $25,000.
# If the applicant is below 25 years old, they must have a co-signer.
# The applicant’s credit score must be above 600.
# The function should take the applicant’s age, income, job status (True/False), co-signer status (True/False), and credit score as inputs and return whether they are eligible for the loan.

# check substring in string

# Write a program which will check if the input given by user contains "Umar" or not

user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
key = "Umar"

if key in user_input:
    print("Success")
else:
    print("Failure")

# Practice Questions

# 1) Write a program that takes a user's input and prints the
# first 5 characters of the string. Then, print the last 3 characters using slicing.

# 2) Modify the above program to print every second character
# from index 2 to 8 in the string name = "Programming".


# 3) Ask the user for their email. Check if it contains both "@" and "."
# and print "Valid email" if both are present, otherwise print "Invalid email."
